# Connect Four

The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model capable of playing Connect Four effectively. To achieve this, we designed and implemented two approaches: a regression model to predict numerical outcomes representing the evaluation of a given position, and a classification model to select the best move among possible options by treating it as a classification problem.
