# Connect Four

The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model capable of playing Connect Four effectively. To achieve this, we designed and implemented two approaches: a regression model to predict numerical outcomes representing the evaluation of a given position, and a classification model to select the best move among possible options by treating it as a classification problem.

## Instalation

You need to install:

- [Python 3.11.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/) and [requirements](requirements.txt)

## Running

To run GUI:

```sh
python src/main.py
```

To create and train model run [`main.ipynb`](regression/main.ipynb).
